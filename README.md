```clarity
(contract-call? .flexstake create-delegation-offer
    u1000               ;; 10% commission rate
    u5000000            ;; 5 STX minimum delegation
    u100000000          ;; 100 STX maximum delegation
    u4320)              ;; 30 days duration
```

#### Auto-Compounding Rewards

```clarity
(contract-call? .flexstake auto-compound-rewards
    'SP1VALIDATOR123...)  ;; Validator address
```

#### Creating Lending Position

```clarity
(contract-call? .flexstake create-lending-position
    u20000000           ;; 20 liquid tokens as collateral
    u10000000           ;; 10 STX borrow amount
    u500                ;; 5% interest rate
    u8640)              ;; 60 days duration
```

#### Initiating Unstaking

```clarity
(contract-call? .flexstake initiate-unstaking
    'SP1VALIDATOR123... ;; Validator address
    u5000000)           ;; 5 liquid tokens to unstake
```
